Now, the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros maintain everything that was great about that design, but updates them to the M2 Pro and M2 Max chips, adding more power and endurance than before.",

Based on its lighter build, speedier performance, helpful Action button, and capable software, the iPhone 15 Pro Max is already a winner. Switching from Apple's old, proprietary Lightning port to the industry standard USB-C may seem overdue, but it expands the iPhone's capabilities in more ways than you might imagine. Add in superior battery life, a longer camera zoom range, and higher base storage than the smaller iPhone 15 Pro, and it's clear the 15 Pro Max is the best iPhone for serious creators and power users, as well as our Editors' Choice winner.",
